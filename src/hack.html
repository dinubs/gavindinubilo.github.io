       *  Nice, you found the HTML source code for ChatBuilder! This document kicks everything off when you load it
       *  in your browser, and is a starting point for the whole app. It's pretty incomplete though--you should
       *  make your own version of it that works better!
       *
       *  You can't edit the code here until it's in a file on your hard drive, so copy this whole page of source
       *  code and paste it into a plain text editor like Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/). Save it as
       *  a `.html` file, and open that file with Google Chrome. You can now edit it however you like, and refresh
       *  the page to see your modifications take effect on how the application runs.
       *
       *  Fair warning: one or more of the steps ahead could require a good amount of research to understand all
       *  the terms and technologies mentioned. Googling words you haven't heard before is a great idea. Just be
       *  careful not to spend too long in 'research mode' without making any forward progress on your real goal of
       *  completing the app!
       *
       *  When you've got this code saved as a local file, uncomment the line of JavaScript code below and open
       *  the new file in Google Chrome. Your next instructions will be waiting for you in the JavaScript console.
       *  If you already know the Chrome JS development tools pretty well, feel free to skip this opening tutorial
       *  by calling the `.start()` function on `Chat.guide` instead of `.intro()`
       *
       *  NOTE: Please do not publish or share any of the code associated with this challenge. We've worked really
       *  hard to build this material and publishing solutions diminishes its effectiveness.
